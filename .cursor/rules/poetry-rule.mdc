# Tooling

Whenever you want to run python, pytest or other python commands, you should do this via poetry,
because this project env is setup via poetry.

The linting tool and style check should be done via ruff. Also through poetry.

# Code structure

For logging use `from qubx import logger` instead of print statements.

Try to use type annotations when possible and don't use Dict or List from typing, instead directly use dict and list for type annotations. Also instead of Optional do "... | None".
