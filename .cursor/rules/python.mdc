# Tooling

Whenever you want to run python commands, you should do this via poetry,
because this project env is setup via poetry.

For testing, use pytest. All tests are located in the tests/qubx directory.

For linting and style checking, use ruff. Run it through poetry.

# Code structure

For logging use `from qubx import logger` instead of print statements.

Try to use type annotations when possible and don't use Dict or List from typing, instead directly use dict and list for type annotations. Also instead of Optional do "... | None".

# Operations

If you need to compile the code, publish something, run all tests, etc,
please check the justfile which contains all of these commands.
The "just" utility is used for running these operations.
