# Task 002: CCXT Testing Architecture Redesign

## Task Overview

Redesign the CCXT data provider testing architecture to match the new component separation. Replace the old monolithic `subscription_lifecycle_test.py` with focused component tests and proper integration tests.

## Current Problem

- Old monolithic `subscription_lifecycle_test.py` tests everything through the facade
- Tests are brittle and use compatibility properties that were removed
- No separation between unit tests and integration tests
- Hard to test individual components in isolation

## New Test Architecture

### 1. Component Unit Tests (Fast, Isolated)

Tests go in `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/` (existing structure, no unit subfolder):

#### A. Core Components

- `test_subscription_manager.py`
  - Test subscription state transitions
  - Test subscription grouping and management
  - Test resubscription cleanup logic
  - Mock dependencies, focus on state management logic

- `test_connection_manager.py`
  - Test WebSocket connection handling
  - Test retry logic and error handling  
  - Test stream lifecycle management
  - Mock WebSocket connections and exchanges

- `test_subscription_orchestrator.py`
  - Test coordination between subscription manager and connection manager
  - Test complex resubscription scenarios
  - Test cleanup and cancellation logic
  - Mock both dependencies

- `test_warmup_service.py`
  - Test warmup task coordination
  - Test error handling and timeouts
  - Test grouping by data type and period
  - Mock handlers and async execution

#### B. Data Type Handlers

- `test_handler_factory.py`
  - Test handler registration and retrieval
  - Test handler caching
  - Test error cases (unknown data types)

- Individual handler tests:
  - `test_ohlc_handler.py`
  - `test_trade_handler.py`  
  - `test_orderbook_handler.py`
  - `test_quote_handler.py`
  - `test_liquidation_handler.py`
  - `test_funding_rate_handler.py`
  - `test_open_interest_handler.py`

Each handler test:

- Test `prepare_subscription()` returns correct SubscriptionConfiguration
- Test `warmup()` with various parameters
- Mock exchange and data provider dependencies
- Test data conversion and processing logic
- Test error handling (parsing errors, missing data)

### 2. Integration Tests (Slower, Real Dependencies)

#### A. Component Integration

- `test_ccxt_data_provider_integration.py`
  - Test facade coordination between all components
  - Test end-to-end subscription flows
  - Test complex scenarios (multiple data types, resubscriptions)
  - Use mock exchange but real component integration
  - Mark with `@pytest.mark.integration`

#### B. Real Exchange Tests

- `test_binance_um_swap_integration.py`
  - Test with real Binance UM swap exchange
  - Test all data types: OHLC, trades, orderbook, quotes, funding rates, open interest
  - Test subscription lifecycle: subscribe → data flow → unsubscribe
  - Test warmup functionality
  - Test error handling (network issues, invalid symbols)
  - Test edge cases: rapid resubscriptions, instrument changes
  - Mark as `@pytest.mark.integration` and require API credentials

### 3. Test Utilities

#### Common Fixtures

- Update `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/conftest.py`
  - Shared fixtures for mock exchanges
  - Mock instruments and data
  - Common test utilities
  - Component fixtures for isolated testing

#### Test Data

- Create `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/fixtures/`
  - Sample CCXT data responses
  - Common test instruments
  - Error scenarios data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Architectural Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

**Fixed CcxtDataProvider architectural issues before implementing tests:**

1. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed redundant `_listen_to_stream()` delegation wrapper
   - Method was just forwarding calls to ConnectionManager
   - Handlers can use ConnectionManager directly through orchestrator

2. **✅ COMPLETED** Moved `_call_by_market_type()` logic to utility function
   - Created `create_market_type_batched_subscriber()` in utils.py
   - Updated all 5 handlers (trade, liquidation, orderbook, ohlc, quote) to use utility
   - Added convenience wrapper in SubscriptionOrchestrator for backward compatibility

3. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed confusing stop methods
   - Eliminated `_stop_subscriber()` and `_stop_old_subscriber()` delegation wrappers
   - These were redundant facades that just called orchestrator/connection manager
   - Simplified the interface and removed unnecessary indirection

4. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed `_mark_subscription_active()` delegation wrapper
   - ConnectionManager already calls SubscriptionManager directly
   - Another redundant facade method eliminated

5. **✅ COMPLETED** Cleaned up imports and reduced CcxtDataProvider complexity
   - Removed ~50 lines of redundant delegation code
   - Cleaner separation of concerns between facade and components

### Phase 1: Core Component Tests ✅ IN PROGRESS

1. **✅ IN PROGRESS** Create `test_subscription_manager.py` - Test state management in isolation
   - Test subscription state transitions (pending → active)
   - Test subscription grouping and management
   - Test resubscription cleanup logic
   - Mock dependencies, focus on state management logic

2. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_connection_manager.py` - Test WebSocket connection handling
   - Test stream lifecycle management
   - Test retry logic and error handling
   - Mock WebSocket connections and exchanges

3. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_subscription_orchestrator.py` - Test component coordination
   - Test coordination between subscription manager and connection manager
   - Test complex resubscription scenarios

4. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_warmup_service.py` - Test warmup orchestration
   - Test warmup task coordination
   - Test error handling and timeouts
   - Test grouping by data type and period

### Phase 2: Handler Tests ✅ PENDING  

1. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_handler_factory.py` - Test handler registration/creation
   - Test handler registry and retrieval
   - Test handler caching mechanism
   - Test error cases (unknown data types)

2. **✅ PENDING** Create individual handler tests for all 7 data types
   - Each handler test should validate `prepare_subscription()` and `warmup()` methods
   - Test SubscriptionConfiguration creation
   - Test data conversion and processing logic
   - Test error handling (parsing errors, missing data)
   - Mock exchange and data provider dependencies

### Phase 3: Integration Tests ✅ PENDING

1. **✅ PENDING** Create facade integration tests with mock exchange
   - Test end-to-end subscription flows
   - Test complex scenarios (multiple data types, resubscriptions)
   - Use mock exchange but real component integration

2. **✅ PENDING** Create real Binance UM swap tests (require API credentials)
   - Test all data types with real exchange
   - Test subscription lifecycle and error handling
   - Mark as `@pytest.mark.integration`

### Phase 4: Cleanup ✅ PENDING

1. **✅ PENDING** Delete old `subscription_lifecycle_test.py`
2. **✅ PENDING** Update any remaining tests that use old patterns
3. **✅ PENDING** Update CI/CD to run new test structure

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Fast Feedback**: Component tests run quickly, identify issues immediately
2. **Isolation**: Each component tested independently  
3. **Reliability**: Less flaky than large integration tests
4. **Coverage**: Better test coverage of edge cases
5. **Maintainability**: Tests match code architecture
6. **Real-world Validation**: Integration tests ensure everything works together

## Testing Strategy Notes

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual components with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interaction and real exchange functionality
- **Use existing test structure**: `tests/qubx/` is already the unit test location
- **Mark integration tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.integration` for slower tests
- **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and able to run in any order
- **Mock external dependencies**: Unit tests should not depend on real exchanges or network

## ✅ PHASE 5 COMPLETED: Unsubscribe Functionality Debugging and Testing

**Problem Identified:** 
User reported that `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")` was not working as expected.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The Qubx subscription system uses a **two-phase commit pattern**:
1. `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")` only stages the unsubscribe operation in `_pending_stream_unsubscriptions`
2. **`ctx.commit()` must be called to actually apply the unsubscribe operation**

**Key Components Involved:**
- `StrategyContext.unsubscribe()` (context.py:492-493) - delegates to subscription manager
- `SubscriptionManager.unsubscribe()` (subscription.py:63-78) - stages unsubscribe in pending changes
- `SubscriptionManager.commit()` (subscription.py:81-133) - applies all pending subscription changes

**Solution:**
```python
# This only stages the unsubscribe - does NOT actually unsubscribe yet
ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")

# This is REQUIRED to actually apply the unsubscribe
ctx.commit()
```

**Comprehensive Test Suite Added:**
Created `TestSubscriptionUnsubscribeWorkflow` in `test_integration.py` with 4 tests:

1. **`test_unsubscribe_requires_commit`** - Demonstrates the core issue and solution
   - Shows that `unsubscribe()` only stages changes
   - Proves that `commit()` is required to apply unsubscribe
   - Validates that the data provider's unsubscribe method is called correctly

2. **`test_global_unsubscribe_requires_commit`** - Tests global unsubscribe behavior
   - Tests `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")` without specific instruments
   - Validates commit pattern for global unsubscribes

3. **`test_multiple_operations_batched_in_commit`** - Tests batching behavior
   - Shows multiple subscription operations can be batched
   - Validates that all operations are applied in a single commit

4. **`test_commit_is_idempotent`** - Tests commit safety
   - Ensures multiple `commit()` calls don't cause issues
   - Validates that commit is safe to call repeatedly

**Test Results:**
All 4 tests pass, validating the subscription commit pattern works correctly.

**Documentation Impact:**
This behavior should be documented in user guides as it's a common source of confusion. The two-phase commit pattern provides transactional safety but requires explicit commit calls.

## ✅ ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY: Real Unsubscribe Bug Found

**Integration Test with Real Exchange:**
Created `test_funding_rate_unsubscribe_workflow` in `test_binance_um_swap_integration.py` to test with real Binance UM exchange.

**Critical Bug Discovered:**
The integration test revealed a **significant architectural issue** beyond the commit pattern:

**Root Cause of Real Bug:**
1. `CcxtDataProvider.unsubscribe("funding_rate", [instrument])` calls `subscription_manager.remove_subscription()`
2. `remove_subscription()` only updates internal state (`_subscriptions`, `_pending_subscriptions`)
3. **No mechanism exists to actually stop the WebSocket stream in ConnectionManager**
4. The funding rate WebSocket stream continues running and sending data to the channel
5. Data continues flowing even after "unsubscribe" is called

**Evidence:**
- Test shows 10+ funding rate updates continue to arrive after calling `unsubscribe()`
- This happens with both `unsubscribe()` method and `subscribe([], reset=True)` 
- WebSocket connection remains active and streams data indefinitely

**Impact:**
- `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")` followed by `ctx.commit()` **still won't work**
- The issue is not just missing commit - it's incomplete unsubscribe architecture
- This affects all data types, not just funding rates

**Test Status:**
- Marked test with `@pytest.mark.xfail` to document known bug
- Test serves as regression test for when bug is fixed
- Comprehensive documentation in test docstring explains the architectural issue

## ✅ ARCHITECTURAL BUG FIXED

**Root Cause Solution:**
Modified `CcxtDataProvider.unsubscribe()` to properly coordinate between subscription state and WebSocket streams.

**Fix Implementation:**
```python
def unsubscribe(self, subscription_type: str, instruments: List[Instrument]) -> None:
    """Unsubscribe from instruments and stop stream if no instruments remain."""
    # Check if subscription exists before removal
    had_subscription = subscription_type in self._subscription_manager._subscriptions
    
    # Remove instruments from subscription manager
    self._subscription_manager.remove_subscription(subscription_type, instruments)
    
    # If subscription was completely removed (no instruments left), stop the stream
    subscription_removed = (
        had_subscription and 
        subscription_type not in self._subscription_manager._subscriptions
    )
    
    if subscription_removed:
        # Use async loop to call the async stop_subscription method
        async def _stop_subscription():
            await self._subscription_orchestrator.stop_subscription(subscription_type)
        
        # Submit the async operation to the event loop
        try:
            self._loop.submit(_stop_subscription()).result(timeout=5)
            logger.debug(f"Stopped stream for {subscription_type}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to stop stream for {subscription_type}: {e}")
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Added orchestrator call**: When all instruments are unsubscribed, calls `stop_subscription()`
2. **Proper async handling**: Uses `AsyncThreadLoop` to call async orchestrator method from sync context
3. **Conditional stopping**: Only stops stream when subscription is completely empty
4. **Error handling**: Graceful handling of stop operation failures
5. **Logging**: Debug/error logging for troubleshooting

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Integration test with real Binance exchange now passes
- ✅ All 113 existing CCXT tests continue to pass (no regressions)
- ✅ Funding rate data stops flowing immediately after unsubscribe
- ✅ Handler's `un_watch_funding_rates` function is properly called
- ✅ Resubscription works correctly after unsubscribe

**Complete Solution:**
Now both parts of the original issue are resolved:
1. **Context-level**: `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate"); ctx.commit()` works correctly
2. **Data provider-level**: WebSocket streams are properly stopped during unsubscribe

The user's `ctx.unsubscribe("funding_rate")` issue is **fully fixed** when followed by `ctx.commit()`.
