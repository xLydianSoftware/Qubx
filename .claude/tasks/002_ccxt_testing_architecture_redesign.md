# Task 002: CCXT Testing Architecture Redesign

## Task Overview

Redesign the CCXT data provider testing architecture to match the new component separation. Replace the old monolithic `subscription_lifecycle_test.py` with focused component tests and proper integration tests.

## Current Problem

- Old monolithic `subscription_lifecycle_test.py` tests everything through the facade
- Tests are brittle and use compatibility properties that were removed
- No separation between unit tests and integration tests
- Hard to test individual components in isolation

## New Test Architecture

### 1. Component Unit Tests (Fast, Isolated)

Tests go in `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/` (existing structure, no unit subfolder):

#### A. Core Components

- `test_subscription_manager.py`
  - Test subscription state transitions
  - Test subscription grouping and management
  - Test resubscription cleanup logic
  - Mock dependencies, focus on state management logic

- `test_connection_manager.py`
  - Test WebSocket connection handling
  - Test retry logic and error handling  
  - Test stream lifecycle management
  - Mock WebSocket connections and exchanges

- `test_subscription_orchestrator.py`
  - Test coordination between subscription manager and connection manager
  - Test complex resubscription scenarios
  - Test cleanup and cancellation logic
  - Mock both dependencies

- `test_warmup_service.py`
  - Test warmup task coordination
  - Test error handling and timeouts
  - Test grouping by data type and period
  - Mock handlers and async execution

#### B. Data Type Handlers

- `test_handler_factory.py`
  - Test handler registration and retrieval
  - Test handler caching
  - Test error cases (unknown data types)

- Individual handler tests:
  - `test_ohlc_handler.py`
  - `test_trade_handler.py`  
  - `test_orderbook_handler.py`
  - `test_quote_handler.py`
  - `test_liquidation_handler.py`
  - `test_funding_rate_handler.py`
  - `test_open_interest_handler.py`

Each handler test:

- Test `prepare_subscription()` returns correct SubscriptionConfiguration
- Test `warmup()` with various parameters
- Mock exchange and data provider dependencies
- Test data conversion and processing logic
- Test error handling (parsing errors, missing data)

### 2. Integration Tests (Slower, Real Dependencies)

#### A. Component Integration

- `test_ccxt_data_provider_integration.py`
  - Test facade coordination between all components
  - Test end-to-end subscription flows
  - Test complex scenarios (multiple data types, resubscriptions)
  - Use mock exchange but real component integration
  - Mark with `@pytest.mark.integration`

#### B. Real Exchange Tests

- `test_binance_um_swap_integration.py`
  - Test with real Binance UM swap exchange
  - Test all data types: OHLC, trades, orderbook, quotes, funding rates, open interest
  - Test subscription lifecycle: subscribe → data flow → unsubscribe
  - Test warmup functionality
  - Test error handling (network issues, invalid symbols)
  - Test edge cases: rapid resubscriptions, instrument changes
  - Mark as `@pytest.mark.integration` and require API credentials

### 3. Test Utilities

#### Common Fixtures

- Update `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/conftest.py`
  - Shared fixtures for mock exchanges
  - Mock instruments and data
  - Common test utilities
  - Component fixtures for isolated testing

#### Test Data

- Create `tests/qubx/connectors/ccxt/fixtures/`
  - Sample CCXT data responses
  - Common test instruments
  - Error scenarios data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0: Architectural Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

**Fixed CcxtDataProvider architectural issues before implementing tests:**

1. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed redundant `_listen_to_stream()` delegation wrapper
   - Method was just forwarding calls to ConnectionManager
   - Handlers can use ConnectionManager directly through orchestrator

2. **✅ COMPLETED** Moved `_call_by_market_type()` logic to utility function
   - Created `create_market_type_batched_subscriber()` in utils.py
   - Updated all 5 handlers (trade, liquidation, orderbook, ohlc, quote) to use utility
   - Added convenience wrapper in SubscriptionOrchestrator for backward compatibility

3. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed confusing stop methods
   - Eliminated `_stop_subscriber()` and `_stop_old_subscriber()` delegation wrappers
   - These were redundant facades that just called orchestrator/connection manager
   - Simplified the interface and removed unnecessary indirection

4. **✅ COMPLETED** Removed `_mark_subscription_active()` delegation wrapper
   - ConnectionManager already calls SubscriptionManager directly
   - Another redundant facade method eliminated

5. **✅ COMPLETED** Cleaned up imports and reduced CcxtDataProvider complexity
   - Removed ~50 lines of redundant delegation code
   - Cleaner separation of concerns between facade and components

### Phase 1: Core Component Tests ✅ IN PROGRESS

1. **✅ IN PROGRESS** Create `test_subscription_manager.py` - Test state management in isolation
   - Test subscription state transitions (pending → active)
   - Test subscription grouping and management
   - Test resubscription cleanup logic
   - Mock dependencies, focus on state management logic

2. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_connection_manager.py` - Test WebSocket connection handling
   - Test stream lifecycle management
   - Test retry logic and error handling
   - Mock WebSocket connections and exchanges

3. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_subscription_orchestrator.py` - Test component coordination
   - Test coordination between subscription manager and connection manager
   - Test complex resubscription scenarios
   - Test cleanup and cancellation logic

4. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_warmup_service.py` - Test warmup orchestration
   - Test warmup task coordination
   - Test error handling and timeouts
   - Test grouping by data type and period

### Phase 2: Handler Tests ✅ PENDING  

1. **✅ PENDING** Create `test_handler_factory.py` - Test handler registration/creation
   - Test handler registry and retrieval
   - Test handler caching mechanism
   - Test error cases (unknown data types)

2. **✅ PENDING** Create individual handler tests for all 7 data types
   - Each handler test should validate `prepare_subscription()` and `warmup()` methods
   - Test SubscriptionConfiguration creation
   - Test data conversion and processing logic
   - Test error handling (parsing errors, missing data)
   - Mock exchange and data provider dependencies

### Phase 3: Integration Tests ✅ PENDING

1. **✅ PENDING** Create facade integration tests with mock exchange
   - Test end-to-end subscription flows
   - Test complex scenarios (multiple data types, resubscriptions)
   - Use mock exchange but real component integration

2. **✅ PENDING** Create real Binance UM swap tests (require API credentials)
   - Test all data types with real exchange
   - Test subscription lifecycle and error handling
   - Mark as `@pytest.mark.integration`

### Phase 4: Cleanup ✅ PENDING

1. **✅ PENDING** Delete old `subscription_lifecycle_test.py`
2. **✅ PENDING** Update any remaining tests that use old patterns
3. **✅ PENDING** Update CI/CD to run new test structure

## Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Fast Feedback**: Component tests run quickly, identify issues immediately
2. **Isolation**: Each component tested independently  
3. **Reliability**: Less flaky than large integration tests
4. **Coverage**: Better test coverage of edge cases
5. **Maintainability**: Tests match code architecture
6. **Real-world Validation**: Integration tests ensure everything works together

## Testing Strategy Notes

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on testing individual components with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interaction and real exchange functionality
- **Use existing test structure**: `tests/qubx/` is already the unit test location
- **Mark integration tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.integration` for slower tests
- **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and able to run in any order
- **Mock external dependencies**: Unit tests should not depend on real exchanges or network

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Phase 1: Core component tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Phase 2: Handler tests ✅ COMPLETED 
- [x] Phase 3: Integration tests ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Phase 4: Cleanup old tests ✅ COMPLETED
