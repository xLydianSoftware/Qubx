"""Shared two-stream executions connector base for split orders/fills venues.

Most venues (Binance) carry an order's fills inline on the ``watch_orders`` report,
so the base ``CcxtConnector`` reads everything from a single stream. OKX and Bitfinex
instead split the account feed:

- ``watch_orders`` carries ONLY status transitions (Accepted / Canceled / Expired /
  Rejected, and a terminal Filled flag) — NO fill/trade detail.
- ``watch_my_trades`` carries the executions (the per-trade fills).

``_TwoStreamCcxtConnector`` adapts the base connector to that split by staying dumb
(hybrid event model — the AccountManager correlates the two streams, not the connector):

1. Running TWO ``_run_ws_loop`` loops concurrently (one per stream), reusing the
   base's reconnect/backoff/teardown so the split path inherits the same resilience
   as the single-stream path. Only the order loop owns liveness (``mark_ready``).
2. Turning each ``watch_my_trades`` trade into a ``Deal`` and emitting one
   ``DealEvent`` per trade. A DealEvent never changes order status — it only books
   the fill into the position/ledger, deduped by trade_id.
3. Emitting plain status events off ``watch_orders`` — ``OrderPartiallyFilledEvent``
   / ``OrderFilledEvent`` with ``fill=None`` — which transition the order without
   booking anything. Whichever stream wins the race, AM's per-order trade-id dedup
   keeps the application idempotent.
